# Cloud Platform Cost Calculator

Use [infracost] to work out the running costs of namespaces in the Cloud
Platform, and post the data to [How Out Of Date Are We][hoodaw]

The intention is to make this "smarter" over time, distributing shared cluster
costs (such as the cluster nodes themselves, and the cost of the cloud platform
team) across namespaces.
